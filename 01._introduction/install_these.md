# Install these

**Type:** Individual

### Editor/IDE
Have an editor/IDE ready (including renewing licenses). You are free to use any editor during the course. I will use VSCode and Vim but it has very little significance for the lectures.

### Ensure that you can run ssh in your terminal
Run ssh in your terminal. If you get a message that it is not installed then you need to install it or use a different terminal. This is needed already for the first lecture!

### Windows users only
Install Chocolatey: [https://chocolatey.org/](https://chocolatey.org/)

Don't use CMD, use Git Bach.

### Mac users only
Install homebrew: [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)

### Windows users only - Install Python2
Try out your package manager
Now that you have chocolately installed see if you can install Python 2:

```
    choco install python2
```

### Install Postman and create account
[https://www.postman.com/](https://www.postman.com/)

Create an account. We will be using features that require the non-lightweight version as they call it. You can use a throwaway email to signup.
