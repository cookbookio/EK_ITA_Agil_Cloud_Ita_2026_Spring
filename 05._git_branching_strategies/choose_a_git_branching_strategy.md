## Exam requirement

For the exam your group will be expected to have picked a workflow and branching strategies.

Every group member should be able to talk about the chosen version control strategy and reflect on the pros and cons.

### Document for the exam report

Create a document for the exam report that answers the following questions:

- What version control strategy did you choose and how did you actually do it / enforce it?

- Why did your group choose the one you did? Why did you not choose others?

- What advantages and disadvantages did you run into during the course?


### An agile document
This document should be reviseted during the course. It is not a static document that you write now and never think about again. It is a working document that is updated whenever things change in your strategies.
